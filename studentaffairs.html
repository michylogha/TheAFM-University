<h2>Orientation - Convocation</h2>
<p>Within the first two weeks after classes have officially begun, the Student Affairs Office conducts an Orientation Convocation for every College. This helps new students to be familiar with the philosophy, vision, mission of the school, the institutional rules, policies and regulaÂ­tions, the school facilities, the administrators, faculty and staff, school activities, clubs and organizations, career guidance, student services, and other information. To augment the general orientation, personnel from the Guidance Center and Library hold smaller classroom interaction dealing with more specific matters. </p>
